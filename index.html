    <h1>What is Online Banking?</h1>
    <h2 class="bank">Online Definition & Example</h2>
    <p class="mam">Online banking gives you the ability to manage your bank account over the internet using a computer or mobile device.There’s no need to visit a bank branch, and can do all of your banking tasks when it’s most convenient for you,
      including outside of normal banking hours.

    </p>
    <p class="mam">Learn more about online banking and why it is often easier, less expensive, and safer than in-person banking.

    </p>
    <h2>What is Online BANKING?</h2>
    <p class="mam">You can bank online through an online-only bank or online-only credit union or through the suite of online services that most brick-and-mortar banks and local credit unions now offer. You can typically pay bills, transfer funds,
      apply for a loan, deposit checks, and verify transactions and account balances.

    </p>
    <p class="mam">The one advantage traditional banks and credit unions have had over their online counterparts is the ability to withdraw funds using an ATM. Increasingly, online banks and credit unions are providing access to a network of ATMs
      that won't charge you a fee. And some financial institutions will reimburse your ATM fees up to a certain amount each month.

    </p>
    <h2>How Online Bank Work</h2>
    <p class="mam">Online banking is designed to be convenient, saving you time and letting you do banking on your own schedule rather than only during the hours your local bank branch is open. Almost anything you can do at a traditional bank or
      credit union location you can accomplish online, starting with opening an account.

    </p>
    <h2>Opening Account</h2>
    <p class="mam">You can open checking, savings, and other types of accounts online, often without the hassle of printing or physically signing anything. With electronic signature capability, the entire process might now take less than 10 minutes.

    </p>
    <p class="mam">If you're a customer of a financial institution that offers online banking, you can register for online access through that institution's website. At a minimum, you'll usually need the following items to get started online:
